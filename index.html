    <h1 class="header">About the Editor</h1>
    <img src="KylaHeadshot.png" style="float: right;" height="300px" width="300px" title="headshot" alt="headshot">
    <p>My name is Kyla Lay, but my authors know me as Ky. I started this business as a freelance editor working for Indie-Authors who needed help at an 
        affordable price. Since starting the business, I've expanded to doing professional development and other genres on top of my usual Indie-Author novels. I also
        edit educational dissertations with a focus on mainly Education Degrees but I am open to any and all degree paths. I graduated college with a bachelor's degree
        in English, and I've been professionally editing with my current authors for several years. I also teach at a small high school in a neighboring city and work
        in a small town in Texas. Between my college and professional experience, I am 100% qualified to help any and every author that I take on. Everything I do is 
        remote but involves heavy communication with each author I work with. Because of that heavy communication, there will never be any question as to what, how, 
        or why I do what I do. I inevitably befriend the authors I take on because I'm fair, easy to get along with, and am personable with everyone. I am always 
        looking to take on more authors and projects in order to turn this small business into a full time career. If you're interested, please feel free to contact 
        me at the form provided. I can't wait to meet you and work on your projects together!</p>
