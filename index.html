    <img src="KylaHeadshot.png" style="float: right;" height="300px" width="300px" title="headshot" alt="headshot">
    <p>My name is Kyla Lay, but my authors know me as Ky. I started this business as a freelance editor working for Indie-Authors who needed help at an 
        affordable price. Since starting the business, I've expanded to doing professional development and other genres on top of my usual Indie-Author novels. I also
        edit educational dissertations with a focus on mainly Education Degrees but I am open to any and all degree paths.</p>
    <p class="barrier">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>I graduated college with a bachelor's degree in English, and I've been professionally editing with my current authors for several years. I also teach at a small 
        high school in a neighboring city and work in a small town in Texas. Between my college and professional experience, I am 100% qualified to help any and every 
        author that I take on. Everything I do is remote but involves heavy communication with each author I work with. Because of that heavy communication, there will 
        never be any question as to what, how, or why I do what I do.</p> 
    <p class="barrier">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
    <p>I inevitably befriend the authors I take on because I'm fair, easy to get along with, and am personable with everyone. I am always looking to take on more authors 
        and projects in order to turn this small business into a full time career. If you're interested, please feel free to contact me at the form provided. I can't wait 
        to meet you and work on your projects together!</p>
