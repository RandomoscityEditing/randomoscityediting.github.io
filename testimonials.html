    <p style="padding-top: 10px;">“Randomoscity Copy and Line Editing is the way to go! I have enjoyed working with Ky from day one. I needed an editor that worked with my 
    budget as an indie-author, and this woman delivered! She is extremely thorough and the suggestions are insightful. Not once did I have to worry about losing my 
    voice or content being changed. I will continue using Randomoscity for my future books!”<br><br>

<p>“Working with Randomoscity Copy and Line Editing has been a pleasure. Ky was so easy to work with and did such an amazing job on the three projects I have had with 
    her. She always has fantastic suggestions that really helped fit the story both grammar and plot wise. Considering I can be pretty bad with grammar at times, it 
    was really great that Ky knew what to look for from the start. I really loved that she went the extra mile and would add comments about the plot, where it flowed,
    where it was off, and just her reactions to reading it along the way were hilarious and fun. I would highly recommend working with her, and I will definitely be 
    having all my future projects edited by her.”<br><br>

<p>"I greatly enjoyed working with Ky when writing my first book: Shadow Witch. She was so professional, easy going, and knowledgeable that she was automatically hired 
    to do the editing for its sequel. Throughout the entire creative process, I felt safe to relay my ideas for the plot to her and expect fair and honest criticism 
    which helped me test the waters for plot elements that I initially considered risky. I intend to hire her for all of my future projects as I cannot see myself 
    using another editor now or anytime in the future. She is the secret ingredient that helped elevate my writing not just in grammar but also in general content. 
    13/10 would definitely recommend her."<br><br>
